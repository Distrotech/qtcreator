    \title Building and Running an Example

    You can test that your installation is successful by opening an existing
    example application project.

    \list 1

        \o  On the \gui Welcome page, select \gui Examples (1).

            \image qtcreator-gs-build-example-open.png "Selecting an example"

        \o  Search for \gui {Toys: Clocks Example} (2) in the list of examples
            and select it (3).

            \note The project opens in the \gui Edit mode, and the documentation
            for the example hides these instructions. To return to these
            instructions, select \gui {Previous Page} on the toolbar or
            press \key {Alt+Left}.

        \o  Select \gui Projects to configure the project:

            \list 1

                \o  Select at least \QS and one of the mobile
                    \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kits} (1), Maemo 5 or
                    MeeGo Harmattan, depending on the device you develop for.

                \o  Select \gui {Configure Project} (2).

            \endlist

        \o  To test the application in \QS, click the \gui {Kit
            Selector} and select \gui {\QS}.

            \image qtcreator-gs-build-example-select-qs.png "Selecting Qt Simulator to run on"

        \o  Click
            \inlineimage qtcreator-run.png
            (\gui Run) to build the application and run it in \QS.

        \o  To see the compilation progress, press \key{Alt+4} to open the
            \gui {Compile Output} pane.

            The \gui Build progress bar on the toolbar turns green when the
            project is successfully built. The application opens in
            \QS.

            \image qt-simulator.png "Qt Simulator"

        \o  Change the settings in the \gui Model view. For example, rotate the
            device by clicking the \gui {Orientation} buttons or choose from the
            various mobile devices in the \gui {Device} field. You
            can also simulate various mobile functions and create your own
            scripts.
