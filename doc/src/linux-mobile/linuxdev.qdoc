    \title Connecting Embedded Linux Devices

    You can connect embedded Linux devices to the development PC to build, run,
    debug, and analyze applications on them from \QC.

    If you have a tool chain for building applications for embedded Linux
    devices (with no MADDE support) installed on the development PC, you can add
    it to \QC. You can then select the \gui {Embedded Linux} target to
    run applications on embedded Linux devices.

    To be able to run and debug applications on embedded Linux devices, you must
    create device configurations and select them in the \QC run
    settings.

    You use a wizard to create the connections. You can edit the settings later
    in \gui {Tools > Options > Linux Devices > Device Configurations}.

    You can protect the connections between \QC and a device by using
    either a password or an SSH key. If you do not have an SSH key, you can
    create it in \QC. For more information, see \l {Generating SSH Keys}.

    To configure connections between \QC and embedded Linux devices:

    \list 1

        \o  Make sure that your device can be reached via an IP address.

        \o  Select \gui {Tools > Options > Build & Run > Qt Versions > Add} to
            add the Qt version
            for the embedded Linux.

        \o  Select \gui {Tools > Options > Build & Run > Tool Chains > Add} to
            add the tool
            chain for building the applications.

        \o  To deploy applications and run them remotely on devices, specify
            parameters for accessing the devices:

            \list 1

                \o  Select \gui {Tools > Options > Linux Devices > Device
                    Configurations > Add > Generic Linux Device > Start Wizard}.

                    \image qtcreator-screenshot-devconf-linux.png "Connection Data wizard"

                \o  In the \gui {The name to identify this configuration} field,
                    enter a name for the connection.

                \o  In the \gui {The device's host name or IP address} field,
                    enter the host name or IP address of the device.

                \o  In the \gui {The user name to log into the device} field,
                    enter the user name to log into the device and run the
                    application as.

                \o  In the \gui {The authentication type} field, select whether
                    to use \gui Password or \gui Key authentication, and enter
                    the user's password or the file that contains the user's
                    private key.

                \o Click \gui {Next} to create the connection.

            \endlist

        \o  To specify build settings:

        \list 1

            \o  Open a project for an application you want to develop for the
                device.

            \o  Select \gui {Projects > Desktop > Build}.

            \o  Select the Qt version and tool chain for the embedded Linux
                device.

        \endlist

        \o To specify run settings:

        \list 1

            \o  Select \gui {Run > Add > Deploy to Remote Linux Host}
                to add a new deploy configuration.

                \image qtcreator-run-settings-linux-devices.png "Run settings for embedded Linux devices"

            \o  In the \gui {Device configuration} field, select the device
                connection.

        \endlist

    When you run the project, \QC deploys the application as specified by the
    deploy steps. By default, \QC copies the application files to the device.
    For more information, see \l{Deploying Applications to Linux-Based Devices}.

    \endlist
